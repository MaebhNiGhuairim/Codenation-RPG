-this is basic, would be more elaborate and written better later -

Choose your name 

Are you a light wizard or are you a dark wizard?

Light Wizard

- You’re a recently graduated wizard of the “Cool Name” academy. You’re excited to explore the extent of your power which had been, for so long, hemmed in by the sensibilities of the wizarding elders. 
- You had always heard of a mystical creature which imparted great wisdom to the one who slayed it. Whilst at the academy, you had secretly studied how to find the creature, and you set out confidently, sure of your worthiness to possess great wisdom. However, you were woefully inexperienced, and managed to offend the creature, who not only did not provide you with great wisdom, but punished you by taking your powers from you. You are devastated. You wander lost for a long time, before hearing of a great wizard who would know how to restore your power. You seek him out 

(To do this quickly, I made it very simple - other options would be a more noble reason for doing the thing, like to save the life of another person - we could also have the consequence different - like the person dies, and the task is to bring them back to life? This is obviously more complicated coding-wise)


Dark Wizard

- You’re a recently graduated wizard of “Cool Name” academy. You’re excited to explore the extent of your power which had been, for so long, hemmed in by the sensibilities of the wizarding elders. 
- You had always heard of a mystical creature which imparted great power to the one who slayed it. Whilst at the academy, you had secretly studied how to find the creature, and you set out confidently, sure of your ability to obtain power by any means necessary. However, you were woefully inexperienced, and not only were unable to slay the creature, but the creature pierced your heart, stealing your power from you. You are devastated. You wander lost for a long time, before hearing of a great wizard who would know how to restore your power. You seek him out 


You meet McGrumble 

- He gives you a riddle to prove your wizard status, as you’re powerless and therefore cannot proof yourself any other way 

You answer the riddle 

He sets your out tasks 


You either complete them or die 

Having completed them, McGrumble restores your power (or you give him the keys etc)

Happy days, you have your power and you’re humbled
